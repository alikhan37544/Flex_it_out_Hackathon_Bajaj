        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Wrong! The correct sequence was: ", sequence)

# Placeholder for gesture-controlled maze logic
def maze_game():
    print("This is a placeholder for a gesture-controlled maze game.")
    # Implement gesture recognition and maze logic here

if __name__ == "__main__":

```

### 5. Hand Gesture Drawing

# Placeholder for hand gesture drawing logic
def drawing_app():
    print("This is a placeholder for a hand gesture drawing application.")
    # Implement drawing logic with gesture recognition here

### 6. Gesture-Based Quiz Game
```python
# gesture_based_quiz_game.py
import random

def quiz_game():
    questions = {
        "What is the capital of France?": "Paris",
        "What is 2 + 2?": "4",
        "What is the color of the sky?": "blue"
    }
    
    question = random.choice(list(questions.keys()))
    print(question)
    user_answer = input("Your answer: ")
    
    if user_answer.lower() == questions[question].lower():
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Wrong! The correct answer is: ", questions[question])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    quiz_game()
```

### 7. Virtual Sports
```python
# virtual_sports.py
# Placeholder for virtual sports logic
def virtual_sports_game():
    print("This is a placeholder for a virtual sports game.")
    # Implement sports logic with gesture recognition here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    virtual_sports_game()
```

### 8. Gesture-Controlled Music Player
```python
# gesture_controlled_music_player.py
# Placeholder for gesture-controlled music player logic
def music_player():
    print("This is a placeholder for a gesture-controlled music player.")
    # Implement music control logic with gesture recognition here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    music_player()
```

### Notes:
- The above code snippets are basic examples and placeholders for more complex implementations.
- For gesture recognition, you would typically use libraries like OpenCV or MediaPipe, which are not included in these snippets.
- Ensure you have the necessary sound files for the virtual piano and implement the actual gesture recognition logic for the other games.
- You can expand upon these examples to create fully functional games.
